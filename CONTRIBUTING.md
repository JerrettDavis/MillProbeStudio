# Contributing to Mill Probe Studio

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Mill Probe Studio as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## üöÄ **Getting Started**

### Development Environment Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/MillProbeStudio.git
   cd MillProbeStudio
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
5. **Run tests** to ensure everything works:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

### Development Workflow

1. **Create a branch** for your work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards
3. **Add tests** for new functionality
4. **Run the test suite**:
   ```bash
   npm test
   npm run lint
   ```
5. **Commit your changes** using [Conventional Commits](#commit-message-format)
6. **Push to your fork** and submit a pull request

## üìù **Commit Message Format**

We use [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) for automatic semantic versioning and changelog generation.

### Format
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- `ci`: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
- `chore`: Other changes that don't modify src or test files

### Examples
```bash
feat: add 3D probe path visualization
fix: resolve G-code parsing issue with comments
docs: update README with new installation steps
feat!: redesign machine settings API

BREAKING CHANGE: machine settings now use different parameter names
```

## üß™ **Testing Guidelines**

- **Write tests** for all new features and bug fixes
- **Maintain test coverage** above 80% for new code
- **Use descriptive test names** that explain what is being tested
- **Follow the AAA pattern**: Arrange, Act, Assert

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:ui
```

### Test Structure
```typescript
describe('Component/Function Name', () => {
  it('should do something specific when condition is met', () => {
    // Arrange
    const input = 'test input';
    
    // Act
    const result = functionUnderTest(input);
    
    // Assert
    expect(result).toBe('expected output');
  });
});
```

## üé® **Code Style Guidelines**

We use automated tools to maintain consistent code style:

- **ESLint** for JavaScript/TypeScript linting
- **Prettier** for code formatting (integrated with ESLint)
- **TypeScript** for type safety

### Key Principles
- **Use TypeScript** for all new code
- **Prefer functional components** with hooks
- **Use descriptive variable names**
- **Keep functions small and focused**
- **Add JSDoc comments** for complex functions
- **Prefer composition over inheritance**

### Example Code Style
```typescript
interface ProbeOperation {
  id: string;
  position: Position3D;
  description?: string;
}

/**
 * Generates G-code for a probe operation
 * @param operation - The probe operation to convert
 * @returns Formatted G-code string
 */
const generateProbeGCode = (operation: ProbeOperation): string => {
  const { position, description = 'Probe operation' } = operation;
  
  return [
    `G0 X${position.x} Y${position.y} Z${position.z}`,
    `G31 Z${position.z - 10} F100`,
    'G0 Z5'
  ].join('\n');
};
```
